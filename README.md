# General Issue Tracker

This is an empty repository. On GitHub, every issue tracker must always be associated with a single repository. We are keeping this repository only to satisfy this requirement.

We use **multiple issue trackers** in GitHub. Each EWP repository has its own, separate issue tracker. If you plan to submit a new issue, and the topic of this issue applies to the contents of a single repository only, then please submit it in the issue tracker of this repository. On the other hand, **this** repository is for tracking issues which do not apply to any *single* project.
