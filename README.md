# EWP Issue Tracker Repo

This is an empty repository. On GitHub, every issue tracker must always be associated with a single repository. We are keeping this repository only to satisfy this requirement.

We plan to use this issue tracker for all issues related to EWP Development ([discuss here](https://github.com/erasmus-without-paper/issues/issues/1)). To enforce this, issue trackers in all other EWP GitHub repositories SHOULD be disabled.

[Click here to open the issue tracker](https://github.com/erasmus-without-paper/issues/issues) (or simply switch to the *Issues* tab).
